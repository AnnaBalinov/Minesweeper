# Minesweeper

<p>Minesweeper is a classic single-player logic game played on a rectangular board. 
The goal is to locate a set number of randomly placed mines in the shortest time possible by clicking on safe squares while avoiding mines. 
This was my first project, built after only three weeks of learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the first time</p>
